Assignment 1. Getting to know your system

Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt
1. How can you get man to print all the commands that have a specific word in 
their man page (or at least the description part of the man page)? (hint: man 
man)
2. Where are the cp and wc programs located in the file system?
3. What executable programs have names that are just one character long, and 
what do they do?
4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, 
which file actually is executed?
5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic 
mode g+s,o-x mean, in terms of permissions?
6. What option to find lets you search for files that have been modified in 
the last three weeks?
7. Use the previous answer to find all directories modified in the last three 
weeks.
8. Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic 
links?
9. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib directory?
10. Where does the locale command get its data from?
11. In Emacs, what commands have sort in their name?
12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-a through C-M-h do? Can you list 
their actions concisely?
13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do?
14. What does the Emacs yank function do?
15. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the 
output of the ls -l command, and the directory listing of the Emacs dired 
command?

: : equivalent to true cmd
[ : condition evaluation utility

for name in $list; do if [ ${#name} -eq 1 ]; then echo $name; fi; done

4A.
/etc/alternatives/emacs
Found by 
ls /usr/bin -l

5A.
g+s: sets group id on execution

13A.
C-g             keyboard-quit
it cancels current cmd
Found by using 
C-h ? b C-x 0 C-s C-g
