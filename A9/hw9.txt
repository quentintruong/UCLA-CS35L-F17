This gets another diffutils

git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'
This checkouts a v3.0 into branch named quote

[quentin@lnxsrv07 ~/Desktop/diffutils]$ patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt 
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c

        maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
    
        This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
        which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
        `like this' or ``like this''.
    
            * src/cmp.c:
            * src/diff.c:
            * src/diff3.c:
            * src/dir.c:
            * src/sdiff.c:
            * src/util.c:
            Quote 'like this' in output.
We see that the changelog entry worked.
