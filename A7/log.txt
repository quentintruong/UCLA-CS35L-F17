Assignment 7. SSH setup and use in applications

---

My partner was Edward Chu who was acting as the client.
I acted as the server.

Install appropriate drivers for Seeed BeagleBone Green Wireless

Connect to the wifi that the BeagleBone creates

sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_b827eb23a6a6_7174706965_managed_psk
connmanctl> quit
This finds and connects to a wifi. 
The UCLA wifi is broken and may not be used for this assignment.
I used my personal mobile hotspot as wifi

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
This updates apt-get and installs xauth for ssh connections

sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
sudo apt-get install xterm
This installs firefox and xterm for port forwarding testing

dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
This verifies that openssh is installed

ifconfig wlan0
This allows us to find the ip addresses on the wifi

Server:
ssh-keygen
This generates public and private keys

sudo useradd -d /home/edward -m edward
sudo passwd edward
This creates an account

cd /home/edward
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R edward .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh
This creates an ssh directory to allow the client to ssh.

Client:
ssh edward@172.20.10.9
This allows the client to ssh if the password is entered correctly

ssh-keygen
This generates the public and private keypair

ssh-copy-id -i edward@172.20.10.9
This adds the client public key to the server for key-based authentication

ssh-add
This allows the client to avoid typing his/her password everytime

ssh edward@172.20.10.9
This verifies that the password does not need to be typed


ssh -X edward@172.20.10.9
This iniates an SSH session with session forwarding. 

xterm
This launches an xterm window which may be used as a terminal

ls -al
touch qtqtqt.txt
ls
This proves that basic commands may be used in this new windows
All commands behave as expected.
