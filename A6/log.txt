echo $PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin/sort:$PATH
echo $PATH
This allow us to verify that /usr/local/cs/bin/sort is not on the path, then adds it to the path, then verifies that it has been added to the path.

od -An -f -N 40MB < /dev/urandom | tr -s [:space:] '\n' > floats.txt
This generates atleast 10,000,000 floats, one float per line, with no spaces.

time -p sort -g floats.txt > /dev/null
This returns the time it takes to sort the floats.

time -p sort -g --parallel=1 floats.txt > /dev/null
This returns the time it takes to sort the floats with 1 thread. Change the 1 to a 2 to use 2 threads, and so on for 4, 8.
