Assignment 3. Modifying and rewriting software

Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

Q1.
Brady's patch removes the line because it is a goto label that is no longer 
used. It was not necessary to remove that line because 
"case_long_iso_time_style:" is a goto and not related to the issue.

Q2.
It should watch out for users in different countries who do not prefer 
English-format dates. Also, it may confuse programs written to parse output 
from the unpatched ls program.

Homework: Rewriting a script

Q3.
The script fails and the following output is caused because the code sets a 
default numLines=1, which later translates into an expectation that the 
provided file has lines. So the program crashes due to out-of-range indexing.
"""
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
    empty
IndexError: list index out of range
"""

Q4.
The script fails and the following output is caused because python3 has 
deprecated this form of the except syntax.
"""
  File "t.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
